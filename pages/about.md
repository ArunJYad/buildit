    - title: What we do
      paragraph: We partner with our clients to solve hard problems, and help them deliver world-class products.We help them improve the way they solve business problems, ultimately changing the way they change.We help organisations understand what they need to do to survive in an ever more rapidly changing world.True transformation only happens when change touches all areas of a company. We believe that change must be holistic and consider all aspects of the organisational stack, from recruitment to procurement, from operations to engineering, and from sales to support. We call this vertical transformation.Read more about some of the technical challenges we've faced, and our thoughts on Design Systems on our Medium blog.

    - title: How we do it
      paragraph: We are problem solvers who hone our craft through experimentation, continuous improvement and systems thinking.We are pragmatic partners who seek out the challenging work in all engagements, whether at enterprise scale or startup speed. This requires us to not only be able to do what "good looks like", but to stand in the middle of something not so good and positively influence the outcome day to day.We enable learning behaviours through high psychological safety; we empower people through trust and autonomy. Read more how we approach organisational change on our Medium blog.

    - title: Our people
      paragraph: Buildit has an open structure, which means that employees work within wide boundaries. The environment and culture, which is shaped by Builditâ€™s people, is driven by several key factors including transparency, curiosity, inclusivity, pragmatism and responsibility. Buildit employees work in an environment where everyone is encouraged to continually develop through a cohesive unit of learning, and perhaps more importantly, given the autonomy to do so. We are part of the larger Wipro network and partner with.
